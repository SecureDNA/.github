# SecureDNA

SecureDNA is a free, non-profit screening platform designed to safeguard DNA synthesis everywhere.

- You can find information about the project as a whole, including papers and a live demo, at the [main site](https://securedna.org).
- Current precompiled `synthclient` binaries are available for [Ubuntu amd64](https://github.com/SecureDNA/ppa).
- Source code for the client and servers is available in our [monorepo](https://github.com/SecureDNA/SecureDNA).
- [quickdna](https://github.com/SecureDNA/quickdna) is a general-purpose DNA manipulation tool but does not have to be separately downloaded to build or run the servers or client.
- To use the production servers with real databases, you'll need to [obtain certificates](https://securedna.org/start/), but you can compile the entire system below and run test servers with test databases and your own certificates.
